**Cplex Python API Sample File**

In this project, you can see how to use Cplex Python API to solve common mathematical programming problems. I wrote this project because I have developed the way to import data into the mathematical programming - by using matrices. Further, you can also create the matrices via Database, Excel file or any other file type which you prefer.

In addition, I have wrote some fundamental algorithms which can be used in some specific programming problems.

1. Linear Programming

2. Mixed Integer Linear Programming

3. Gradient descent method used in unconstrained minimization

New models are coming soon...
