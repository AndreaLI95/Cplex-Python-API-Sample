**Cplex Python API Sample File**

In this project, you can see how to use Cplex Python API to solve common mathematical programming problems. I wrote this project because I have developed the way to import data into the mathematical programming - by using matrices. Further, you can also create the matrices via Database, Excel file or any other file type which you prefer.
